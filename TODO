* Stack check can be activated again

see NList_func.h for STACK_CHECK and STACK_ALERT macros
    NList_mcc.c for Calc_Stack

* move.c (replacement functions for memory copying)

change them with memmove, etc

* porting of other parts

nlist_demo (in demo/ dir) and other test apps and rarely used
classes (in misc/ dir) can be ported too.

* cleaning up warnings

there are many pointer to int without cast warnings.
they are mostly harmless...

* add preferences import/export to the mcp's
  Implement the MUIM_Settingsgroup_ConfigToGadgets
  and MUIM_Settingsgroup_GadgetsToConfig methods.

* anything else? :)
