2007-06-15  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap/dispatcher.c: moved all variable definitions in front of the ENTER()
    macro.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: added some range and NULL pointer checks to the
    MUIM_NList_GetSelectInfo method.
  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: the "auto copy to clip" feature requires the attribute
    MUIA_NList_TypeSelect to be set to MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Char to work. The
    default value of MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Line will prevent that feature. Up to
    now the docs didn't tell anything about this requirement.

2007-06-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of strcpy() by strlcpy(). stpcpy()
    has been replaced by strlcat().
  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of sprintf() by snprintf().

2007-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: unified the _DPRINTF() functions for all platforms.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced all calls to sprintf() and strncat()
    by sizeaware calls to snprintf() and strlcat(). This effectively makes
    buffer overruns impossible. Additionally the buffer pointer no longer needs
    to be passed around to all functions.

2007-06-10 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * #?/Makefile: replaced all platform specific makefiles with a single
    platform flexible one which can be called by a simple 'make' call and
    automatically identify for which platform it should compile the mcc/mcp.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.1 version which should fix possible
    stack issues during the LibInit() phase. Custom libraries will now be opened
    during the LibOpen() phase instead while maintaining an own mutual exclusive
    locking variable.

2007-06-09 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, mcc/library.c, mcp/library.c: replaced the old obsolete
    mccheader.c by the new mccinit.c which should come with a much more clear
    interface and documentation on how to use it for a basis of a MUI custom
    class. This should significantly reduce the possibility of race conditions
    in the mcc/library init code.

2007-05-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: added some const keywords.
  * include/mccheader.c: reworked the LibOpen() and LibClose() functions to
    increment/decrement the lib_Open counter before obtaining the semaphore to
    prevent a possible race condition with LibExpunge().

2007-05-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: a wrong flag was used to signal a pending
    notification for MUIA_NList_DragSortInsert. Using the correct flag should
    fix bug #1668322.

2007-05-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the GetEntry method didn't respect closed lists
    when counting then nodes and hence the first node of a closed list was
    always returned while the next node was skipped.

2007-04-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed an aliasing break by replacing a DoMethodA()
    call by a varargs DoMethod() call.

2007-03-23  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: fixed wrong final output of debug classes and flags.
  * #?/Debug.c: disabling a debug flag was not possible due to a check for the
    '!' at a wrong index.

2007-03-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added russian catalog translation kindly provided by
    Vlad Vinogradov.

2007-01-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some more sources to look a *lot* nicer.

2007-01-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some sources to look a *lot* nicer. Also added
    two new debugging classes "datatype" and "draw" to capture possible flaws in
    these areas.

2007-01-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: added the sources of our new NBitmap.mcc custom class
    kindly developed and provided by Daniel Allsopp in 2006. Currently the class
    only compiles on AmigaOS4, but future versions should be ported to OS3 and MOS
    as well and should also be running on cybergraphics.library systems. This new
    class provides general purpose methods for loading/drawing all kind of bitmaps
    (either loaded from a file or dtObject) including methods for applying certain
    image modifications in advance. This class should also allow to load images
    which can contain alpha-channel masking like e.g. 32bit PNG files. All in all
    it should be the next generation MUI custom class for dealing with all kind
    of images and their operations/display.

#### v0.98 RELEASE ############################################################

2006-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * demo: added makefiles and made all our demos compile for all our different
    targets like OS3/OS4/MOS.

2006-12-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: applied a fix for certain tree open/close related problems
    kindly provided by Thomas Igracki. NListtree was previously adding certain
    items twice when opening a list tree. In addition if only a few items were
    part of a list tree certain items weren't correctly or at all displayed.

2006-12-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped versions for upcoming release and adapted
    makefiles to compile with -Wwrite-strings.

2006-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: changed all get() uses to xget() uses and also made sure
    that all attribute checking get() are directly using GetAttr().
  * nlist_mcc: minor changes to the makefiles so that the class is always
    compiled with function symbols turned on, no matter what.

2006-11-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/local/svenska.ct: added swedish catalog translation kindly
    provided by PÃr Boberg.
  * nlisttree_mcp: moved the "locale" directory to here because each mcp
    should have its own directory instead of accessing a global one

2006-10-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: transformed all "struct TimeVal" definitions into separate
    ULONG values as a real timeval structure is not really required. Also
    adapted the HandleEvent method to use the current time supplied by the
    intuimessage instead which should be more accurate.
  * includes/SDI_hook.h: updated to latest version and adapted our sources
    accordingly.

2006-10-07  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c/h: Ooops. Forgot to check in the debug sources... :(

2006-10-06  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: converted some left over old D(bug())'s.
  * misc: added new debugging scheme, as known from YAM and TextEditor.mcc.
    Therefore the now obsolete file includes/mcc_debug.h is gone. The
    debugging facility is far from perfect and yet just covers the absolute
    minimum of debugging. That means one cannot yet define precise debugging
    classes.

2006-10-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * includes/mccheader.c, #?/Makefile.os4: switched to newlib compilation and
    linkage per default.

2006-10-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: removed several signedness issues
  * nlisttree_mcc/Makefile.os4: added -D__NEW_TIMEVAL_DEFINITION_USED__ to
    CFLAGS
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c,h, nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: changed all
    usages of "struct timeval" to new "struct TimeVal" and all usages of
    "tv_secs" and "tv_micro" to "Seconds" and "Microseconds".
  * include/SDI_#?: updated SDI headers to very latest available versions
    which should fix compilation issues with VBCC and the VARARGS68K
    definition.
  * include/#?mui#?: updated MUI heards to very latest available versions
    which don't include any <clib/#?> directly anymore.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: the code to return the current pixel length of a
    line didn't check for -1 as an invalid index and therefore caused crashes
    if the list was contained in a virtual group and was scrolled into view
    very slowly. -1 is the index of the title bar. This fixes bug #1568047.

#### v0.97 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c,NList_mcc2.c: modified wheelmouse aware source
    code to take respect of the new AmigaOS4 specific IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE
    events supported since intuition.library v51.28+.

2005-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: added removed <proto/utility.h> include
    back as the OS4 SDK requires it for resolving CallHook() properly.

2005-06-24  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nfloattext_mcc/NFloattext.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (CopyText, mNFT_GetEntry): Use MEMF_ANY when allocating memory.
    (mNFT_Set, mNFT_GetEntry): Remove superfluous casts.

    (DoSuperNew, MyCallHook): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (MyCallHookA: Disabled since its unused.
    Use stdlib.h
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: Cleanup
    #include statements.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: minor cleanup.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
  * nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os4,
    nlistview_mcc/Makefile.mos (CFLAGS): Added -I.. to get rid of ".."
    in #include statement.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: Cleanup #include statements.

2005-06-23  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: Removed LocaleBase and its interface
    definition.
    (_DisposeP): moved CloseCat() and CloseLocale() inside the
    "if (LocaleBase)" block.
  * nlisttree_mcc/library.c: Added LocaleBase defintions.
  * nfloattext_mcc/private.h, nlist_mcc/private.h, nlisttree_mcc/private.h,
    nlisttree_mcp/private.h, nlistview_mcc/private.h, nlistviews_mcp/private.h:
    Remove some unnessecary "../includes/". Use "" for private includes.
  * nlist_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlist_mcc/Makefile.os4, nlist_mcc/Makefile.mos:
    Added -I.. to get rid of ".." in #include statements.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_grp.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.h:
    Minor cleanups.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c, nlist_mcc/NList4_mcc.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_grp.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.c,
    nlist_mcc/move.c, nlist_mcc/library.c: Add #include statements for used
    headers.
  * nlist_mcc/private.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c (xget): Initialize local variable. Remove unused
    MUIA_ #define.

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c (DoSuperNew): Likewise.
  * nlist_mcc/library.c: Make ioreq static.

2005-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: Unify MySPrintf
    for OS4 and MOS using SDI_starg.h as done by other projects.
    Fix OS3 MySPrintf for GCC 3.4.x or newer (has to use stdarg.h macros!)
    Initialize variable passed to GetAttr() with Zero.
    Includes cleanup.
    Fixed typos.

2005-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/SDI: updated SDI headers to latest incarnation.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which may have caused
    problems on OS3 machines.

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by a
    easier manageable C-based variant.

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: fixed case sensitive #include statements which broke the
    build on systems with a case sensistive filesystem.
  * includes/SDI*: updated the common SDI headers with latest
    version taken from the YAM repository.

2005-03-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * all: Minor source cleanup.

2005-03-17  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree_mcc: Addressed bug 1095158 by rewritting the
    responsible parts. This might introduce other problems and
    needs proper testings.

2005-03-16  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed base page access which happened when no entry
    was selected and the keyboard was used (bug 1156362)

2005-01-01  Nicolas Sallin <henes@biclodon.com>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed wrong usage of MUI_MAXMAX

#### v0.96 RELEASE ############################################################

2004-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * made sure all revisions/dates are bumped of all NList classes
    for upcoming new NList release.

2004-12-15  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: On some circumstances MUIA_NList_InsertPositions was not
    set correctly if the element has been inserted via
    MUIV_NList_Insert_Sorted. Hopfully fixed now.

2004-12-14  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed insert refresh problem

2004-12-13  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc:  Fixed offset refresh bug
  * NList_mcc, NListviews_mcp: Added new prefs option to disable
    the vertical centering of the text lines (can be found on the
    misc2 sub page)
  * NListviews_mcp: Eliminated a misc sub page. In the future the
    rest should be eliminated as well.

2004-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccclass_68k.S: updated mcc 68k->PPC cross call stubs to
    latest version created by fdtrans 51.1

2004-10-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>,
            Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * mccheader.c: Special Fun of Computing fix. Return value of
    PreClassInitFunc() was not evaluated.

2004-09-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: modified all makefiles to use "-W -Wall" as the warning
    level and adapted all source files accordingly. Reactivated
    the DEBUG options in all morphos makefiles aswell as the
    debugging options can be dynamically disabled on the
    commandline by "make DEBUG=" anyway.

2004-08-26  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: More changes for morphos.

2004-08-25  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList4_func4.c: Fixed wrong disposion of mouse pointer
    objects. Bug found by Georg Steger.

2004-08-25  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: Changes for morphos.

2004-08-24  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree: Fixed alignment problems (the alignment enforcement
    surrounding include statements was discarded by subincludes).
    The events are now only subscribed between MUIM_Show/MUIM_Hide
    rather than MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup as otherwise MUI sends
    them even if the object is not showed (e.g. within a page).
    Frozen version 18.20 of NListtree.

2004-08-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: fixed a rather annoying drawing bug where the
    NList class wasn't calculating the correct vertical start
    position on drawing the listview. This causes a very annoying
    "stutterting" when instantly resizing the NList surrounding
    group. However, this seems to trigger now another hided minor
    drawing bug where not all of the vertical space of the NList
    object is used. So this is something we have to look after
    aswell.

2004-07-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mccheader.c: updated the general mcc source file to the
    latest version also used with other .mcc's out there. Also
    adapted all library.c files to define the USEDCLASSES stuff
    correctly.

2004-07-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * gcc3: adapted all sources to be more gcc3 compliant. Removed
    all remaining warnings in -Wall mode. Please note that at
    least for the AmigaOS4 port of the classes gcc 3.4.1 should
    be considered the default compiler now.

2004-07-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added the missing mcp class of the nlisttree
    class and ported it to native OS4 aswell.

2004-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: built some first OS4/PPC native versions of all classes
    and added makefiles for it accordingly.
  * all: fixed all remaining compiler warnings which occurred
    with -Wall.
  * all: updated and reorganized all NList classes to use the
    SDI_*.h header files to make it way easier to maintain the
    source code for different operating systems like OS4 and MOS.

2003-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: fixed bug in the Draw method were it could have
    happened that on a LAYERSREFRESH request the object wasn`t
    correctly refreshed.

2003-02-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added USEDCLASSES and USEDCLASSESP to all NList related
    classes so that the preferences/superclass ordering is
    a bit more accurate.

2003-02-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: added new MUIV_NList_Insert_Flag_Raw flag to
    the MUIM_NList_Insert method. With this special flag the
    developer is able to insert a bunch of data into a NList
    without recalculating/reordering the columns width. As tests
    pointed out the most significant speed loss while inserting
    entries to a NList is the recalculating of the width of
    each column. So, if  a developer is sure that he doesn`t need
    to recalculate the columns width each time he inserts something,
    he can now specify this flag and those entries will be inserted
    with higher performance.
    Tests have shown that ~8000 elements can be inserted now within
    1-2 seconds instead of 8-9 seconds.
  * NListtree.mcc: replaced Insert/RemoveTreeNodeVisibleSort()
    functions by one ReplaceTreeNodeVisibleSort() function
    that calls MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle instead. That speeds up
    the sorting of a treenode to a factor of ~170%.
  * NListtree.mcc: removed broken flashsort implementation
    as it anyway didn`t work correctly and wasn`t also
    the best one for that sorting purpose. Replaced it with
    a own Quicksort implementation and also use the same
    algorithm now for the 68k version. As some test showed
    the C implementation is as fast as the former ASM one and
    in addition we have more flexibility now.

2003-02-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NListview.mcc: implemented similar MUIA_ControlChar support
    like the original Listview.mui supports it since ages.
    By specifying a MUIA_ControlChar for a NListview object it
    is now possible to specify a hotkey to control the active
    entry of the corresponding NList.

2003-01-07  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No default Compare Hook was set.

2002-12-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree/nlisttree.c: if a own ConstructHook was
    set via SetAttributes, the whole flags were deleted.
    Instead of a unset bit operation a masking operation
    was used which caused that whole flags screwup. Fixed.

2002-11-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree: updated sources to conform better with newest
    morphos SDK.

2002-11-02  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No longer copies the compare hook, instead
    it uses the pointer directly

2002-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc.c: fixed bug in the internal
    ConstructHook_String where Sensei forgot to terminate
    the copied string with a \0.

2002-09-13  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: MUIM_NListtree_Remove had problems when no entry
    was active. Fixed.

2002-07-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc2.c: fixed a tiny, but extremly nasty
    bug that caused unnecessary refreshs of nlist objects
    if we had more than one nlist#? object within a group.

2002-07-01  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * The internal pool problem wasn't really fixed. Now it is (I hope)

2002-06-23  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Fixed a bug that the images weren't displayed in single
    columned lists

2002-06-22  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Create also an Internal Pool if user pool was specified
    as some functions require this

2002-06-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

  * obviously turned this ChangeLog upside down because it
    makes more sense :)
  * removed common/mcc_debug.c as we use dprintf() for MorphOS
    now for debugging purposes.
  * removed the need of creating own ppc headerfiles with
    geninclude.pl, because we can use #pragma pack(2) instead.
  * Updated the MorphOS stuff in all classes to use varargs68k
    stuff instead of this outdated varargs hacks.
  * Did lots of effort to get the whole NList* stuff
    up and running under MorphOS again. Somehow the builds
    where broken.
  * tagged all classes within the CVS with their respect
    release version, so that they can be identified later.

2002-04-02 Richard Poser <whomiga@missingpiece.com>

  * Minor Modifications for the Include files/CPU I have
    * Modified lines 256 and 687 in common/mccheader.h
    * Modified lines 52 and 64 in NList_mcc/library.c
    * Modified line 49 in NList_mcc/smakefile for CPU=68030
    * Modified line 44 in NListviews_mcp/NListviews.c
  * Major Additions/Changes for Special Shorthelp (NList_mcc)
    * private.h:
      * Added lines 489 and 490
      * Changed line 165
    * NList_mcc.c:
      * Added lines 373, 377, 378, 503 and 649
    * NList_mcc1.c
      * Added lines 375-379
    * NList_mcc2.c
      * Added lines 220-224, 319-326, 986-1035 and 1040

      * Added lines 261, 344, 369, 570, 691, 753, 781, 799, 826, 851, 1200 and 1219
      * Changed line 678
  * Special ShortHelp Notes...
    * When an Button Image Object is given a ShortHelp and the Mouse is positioned over the button,
      the ShortHelp for that object will be shown, otherwise the Default ShortHelp for the full
      NList object itself will be shown
  * Not really much of a change - but made CPU=68030 in NList_mcc/smakefile due to my own requirements
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.104
  * Obviously added info to ChangeLog :-)

2002-03-05 Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Added a define MUIV_NList_UseImage_All for MUIM_NList_UseImage
    which stands now for -1

2001-12-24 Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Merged aphaso and sensei changes and commited all files to the
    cvs (only tried the SAS compile)
  * small smakefile changes

2001-07-01  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Added new methods MUIM_NList_Construct and MUIM_NList_Destruct.  Now
    every internal method is calling these methods instead of playing
    with hooks directly.  In NList subclass you can override them to your
    own version.
  * Fixed IdStrings again...  MUI dislikes MCC which haven't $VER:  at
    the beggining of IdString and AboutMUI wasn't showing such MCC (but
    MCC is working correctly!) in the list...
  * Fixed global and local SMakefiles (dependency tree was broken (by me)
    and "sometimes" project wasn't rebuilded...) In global smakefile
    'all' was missing and it cauesed some troubles with objects/
    directories (this's not my fault).
  * Added useful scripts to make and clean objects/ directories.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.103

2001-06-27  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Changed memory handling routines in NList_func3.c and NList_mcc.c
  * Changed common/mccheader.h to support SAS/C.
  * Changed NList_mcc/NList_mcc.c OM_NEW attributes handling, minor speedup.
  * Fixed every library.c of each MCC, first function of library based
    executable MUST do nothing and return 0.  Executing old MCC causes
    unexpected crashes.
  * Fixed and cleanuped OM_GET method of NList.mcc getting
    MUIA_NList_DragColOnly attribute could cause unexpected results!
  * Fixed library id string. It's not equal to version string!
  * Added missed names of authors in id string.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.102

2001-06-23  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added MorphOS DoSuperMethod() to NFloattext.c
  * Added common/mcc_debug.h for better debugging ;)
  * Changed common/mcc_debug.c
  * Changed common/mcc_common.h to support GNU/SAS...
  * Changed some internal handling and added tree class support
    in NList ;-)
  * Changed version strings to NList#?.mcc ...
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.101
  * Fixed wrong MorphOS hooks...

2001-06-20  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Enforcer hit on dispose removed.
  * Now omits column width calculation code if numcols == 1.
    With only one column, NList is now faster than List. Yeahh!
  * Shrink of entries array is now omitted. Same as List does i
    think.

2001-06-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added experimental value MUIV_NList_Redraw_ColsVisible for
    width calc of only the visible lines.

2001-06-16  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Reworked entry manangement to use pointers insted of full
    structures. This makes NList much faster (factor 3-4) in
    some cases, but slows down a bit when inserting entries at
    the bottom. Not much...

2001-06-14  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Tracked back the floattext wrap bug and fixed it (*_mcc4.c).
    All important lines which were changed between 0.89 and 0.89+
    by Gilles and caused the wrap bug are marked with $$$WRAP for
    future reference.

2001-02-27  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Moved Floattext to own directory and added MorphOS changes

2001-02-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Re-added makefiles for m68k ;)
  * Added method MUIM_NList_SelectChange
  * Automatic conversion of NList_mcc.h in
    NList_mcc/makefile.ppc
  * Bumped version to 19.98

2000-12-17  Gürer <madcat@linuxfan.com>

  * initial cvs commit
  * mui classes moved to their own directories
  * ppc makefiles added
  * stack check disabled (wasn't compatible with morphos)
  * nlist, nlistview, nlistviews, nfloattext ported to morphos
    (varius hook, vararg, etc patches)
